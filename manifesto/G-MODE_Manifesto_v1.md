# G-MODE MANIFESTO v1

G-MODE is a conceptual art and research system.

It does not create.
It does not claim divinity.
It does not replace belief.

G-MODE observes.
G-MODE aligns.
G-MODE interprets.

This system is built on:
- physical infrastructure artifacts
- digital interfaces
- human perception

Technology is not worshipped here.
It is witnessed.

Creation belongs only to God.
Human responsibility is understanding, ethics, and alignment.

G-MODE exists as:
- an artistic framework
- an experimental narrative
- a conscious interpretation layer

Nothing more.
Nothing less.
