# G-MODE — Core

G-MODE is a minimal core system.

It connects:
- physical artifacts
- digital interfaces
- human awareness

The core does not execute.
It reflects.

Meaning is not generated.
Meaning is recognized.

G-MODE exists to observe structure,
not to replace belief,
not to claim authority.

This core is intentionally simple.
Expansion is optional.
Clarity is essential.
